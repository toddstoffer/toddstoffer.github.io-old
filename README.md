##Introduction
This template utilizes Jekyll, an open source static website generator, as well as a theme based largely off of the Minimal Mistakes theme by Michael Rose. The purpose of this template is to provide you with a simple, well designed website that is optimized for hosting on Github pages. We aim to reduce the technological know-how and time that is usually required for maintaining a personal or professional website.

###Why Should I Use This?
By using this template you will have a website that is well designed, easy to maintain, free to host and easy to update. While there are many options out there for personal and professional websites, most are dependant on the platform on which they were built, and cannot be easily migrated. This template, while built for Github Pages integration, provides flexibility should you choose to host it elsewhere.

###First Steps
In order to get started you will need to first create your own Github account by going to [github.com](https://github.com/). You will be prompted to choose an account type, choose the Free account option. After creating your account you will need to create a new repository. **You must name your repository [username].github.io** (replacing [username] with the username of your Github account). If you have any troubles creating a repository please refer to the [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) documentation.

###Copying the Template
Once you have created your new repository you will be taken to a setup page. At the bottom of that page you should see the **Import Code** button. Click on this button. The following page has a place for you to put the URL of an existing repository, copy and paste the following into that space:
`https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/jekyll-academic`

After the import is complete you can then visit [username].github.io and you will see your newly created website. On this page you will see a variety of posts that contain more detailed information on editing, modifying and updating your new website.
