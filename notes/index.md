# Good Enough Digital Preservation
### Tools to Use:

- [Coptr](http://coptr.digipres.org/Main_Page)
- [FITS](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/fits/home)
- [CoSA](https://www.statearchivists.org/resource-center/resource-library/)

# Providing Access to Websites
Biggest issue w/ web archiving is now abundance, too much Websites
## Geocities projects1995 10k users 1997 1Mil

## WARCBase - I need to learn this look, team up with hadoop, apache hbase, spark

# Digital Preservation
Something is better than nothing - stop waiting for perfect, the content will dissappear before we are able to preserve it.

# Usability Testing
Usability means that making sure that something works well 3-6 participants to pick up 'most bugs' - don't need a ton of people


# Accessibility
Use HTML5 semantic elements to help things get identified

ARIA - accessible rich internet applications
  - roles (role=alert (may want to interrupt the user), role =status(no interruption needed))
  - states & properties

1)What Must be done > 2)What should be done > 3)what can be done

# Finding Aids w/ HTML5
Finding aids need to keep up with web development

Use existing CSS template to make it look better, be mobile-friendly, mobile-fun

# Spreadsheets

# Identity Hub - Roll your own
[wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page)
